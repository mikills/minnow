// Shard GC handles garbage collection of replaced shard files after compaction
// or other shard-replacing operations.
//
// When compaction merges multiple shards into one replacement shard, the old
// shard files cannot be deleted immediately because in-flight readers may still
// be accessing them. This file implements a delayed GC mechanism that safely
// cleans up old shards after a configurable grace period.
//
// System fit:
//
//   - After compaction publishes a new manifest, replaced shards are enqueued
//     for GC via enqueueReplacedShardsForGC rather than deleted immediately.
//   - A background sweep (SweepDelayedShardGC) processes the queue, deleting
//     shards only after the grace window has elapsed.
//   - Before deletion, the sweep verifies the shard is no longer referenced in
//     the current manifest, preventing accidental deletion of active shards.
//
// Safety guarantees:
//
//   - Grace window (defaultShardGCGraceWindow) ensures in-flight readers have
//     time to finish before shard files are removed.
//   - Manifest check prevents deleting shards that are still active (e.g., if
//     compaction was rolled back or a concurrent writer re-added the shard).
//   - Idempotent: treats ErrNotExist/ErrBlobNotFound as success.
//   - Retry mechanism handles transient delete failures with backoff.
//
// Failure modes:
//
//   - Manifest download failure: entry is re-queued with retry delay.
//   - Delete failure: entry is re-queued with retry delay; first error is
//     returned but sweep continues processing remaining entries.
//   - Shard still referenced: entry is re-queued (may have been re-added by
//     concurrent operation).
